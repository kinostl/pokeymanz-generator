# pokemon_generator

Type in a name, hit submit, and get a table of moves that you can copy into a Google Doc to get the format everyone likes.

## Contributing

`git clone https://github.com/kinostl/pokeymanz-generator/` then `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. We're using preact for all of this.

Contributions need to be able to run on a static website. This means no databases or anything account-like. All effort should happen on the client's host computer.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
